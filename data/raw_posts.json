The same applies to design.\n\n👉 Question for my network:\nWhen it comes to UI/UX, do you prefer visual-heavy designs or minimal, action-first layouts?",

"text": "🚨 𝐌𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐁𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐝𝐈𝐧 🚨\n\nI recently encountered an experience on LinkedIn that underscores the importance of maintaining professional boundaries in online networking. After accepting a connection request from an individual due to a shared connection, I received a message requesting 'friendship' in a manner that was inappropriate and unprofessional for a professional networking platform. This incident highlights the need for all users to uphold respectful and professional interactions with connections on LinkedIn. While the platform is designed for professional networking and exchange of industry-related information, it's crucial to ensure that communications remain appropriate, respectful of boundaries, and focused on professional objectives. Unwanted personal advances are unacceptable and may indicate potential issues with online safety and professional conduct. In professional interactions, respecting all individuals and maintaining clear boundaries is essential for fostering a safe and productive environment. If you experience interactions that make you uncomfortable or seem unprofessional, consider addressing the issue or reporting it to the platform.",

"text": "The ₹5000 'Internship' and the Threat to Blacklist Students...\n\nThis week, I encountered a disturbing pattern of messages targeting first-year students. An entity, posing as an internship provider, was using a textbook scam strategy:\n1. Create Urgency: 'The registration link is active for only 10 minutes!'\n2. Apply Pressure: Constant messages asking for immediate confirmation and payment.\n3. Use Intimidation: When students hesitated, the tone shifted to threats of being 'blacklisted' from their college's placement cell and all future opportunities.\n\nLet's be clear — this is not how legitimate companies operate. A real opportunity builds you up; it never threatens or bullies you.\n\nCurious about their operations, I engaged them. The conversation was revealing. They asked if they could hire me for website work. When I asked about the pay, the offer was ₹150 per project — a figure that is astronomically below market rate and reveals a fundamental disregard for the value of professional work.\n\nMy response was a simple suggestion to check the market rate. The interaction underscores a critical point — an organization that doesn't understand the value of skilled work cannot possibly offer a valuable learning experience.\n\nFor all students and freshers, here are the red flags to watch for:\n🚩 Pressure to Act Immediately: Legitimate companies give you time to decide.\n🚩 Any Demand for Payment: You should not pay to secure an internship.\n🚩 Vague or Threatening Communication: Professional communication is always respectful.\n🚩 The 'Blacklisting' Threat: This is a pure scare tactic. Report it to your college's T&P cell.\n\nLet's use our collective voice to protect aspiring talent. If you've seen similar tactics, share your insights in the comments. Awareness is our best defense.",

"text": "🚨 Aware Post for Students & Job Seekers 🚨\nRecently, I applied for an internship and received a 'Congratulations, you are selected' email the very next day. They scheduled an introduction call, but instead of an actual internship discussion, it turned into a product promotion session.\n👉 They asked me to pay for a 'special training program' before offering the internship and stipend.\n👉 Only a few candidates were told they could apply for the 'paid training' with additional charges.\n👉 The so-called internship was not direct — they were just connecting us to other companies.\nThis was disappointing because many of us apply with genuine hopes of learning and contributing. Fake internship offers like these take advantage of freshers who are eager to build careers.\n⚠️ Important reminder:\nA legitimate internship will never ask you to pay upfront.\nBe cautious of offers that sound 'too easy' or come without any proper evaluation.\nAlways verify the company’s credibility before sharing personal details or paying fees.\nI’m sharing this to spread awareness — getting a real paid internship or job is not easy, and that’s okay. What’s not okay is companies exploiting students in the name of opportunities.\nStay alert. Don’t fall into these traps. 🙏",

"text": "I recently worked on a fun project where I controlled a game using hand gestures instead of the keyboard.\n\nUsing OpenCV and MediaPipe, I built a system that watches my hand through the webcam and recognizes how many fingers I’m showing. Then it converts those gestures into game controls:\n\nFist - Brake\nOpen hand - Accelerate\n1 or 2 fingers - Neutral / Coast\n3 fingers - Toggle on-screen info\n4 fingers - Emergency release\n\nI also added a HUD on the camera window to show which gesture was detected and some safety features like automatic key release when no hand is visible.\n\nIt was exciting to combine computer vision with real-time interaction, and seeing the game respond directly to my hand felt really satisfying!",

"text": "The recent (and now-deleted) podcast of Umar Punjabi with Raj Shamani has sparked some important conversations. As someone in this space, it brings up a few crucial points we need to discuss:\n\n1. The 'Flex Culture' Illusion\nI see a growing trend of 'flex culture' – Lambos, private jets, and luxury watches used as markers of success. While materialism can be a motivator, it's a fragile one. Real, sustainable success is built on purpose, not just on the desire for a Rolex.\n\n2. The Business Model Red Flag\nThe truth is, many of the biggest 'gurus' in our space make more from selling courses than from trading itself. Think about it: if you had a 150 Cr portfolio, would your main focus be on growing it exponentially, or on selling a 10k course?\n\n3. The Responsibility of Platforms\nThis leads to a respectful point for creators like Raj Shamani, whose platform has a powerful legacy. Due diligence is crucial. A seat on a major podcast is a powerful endorsement, and when guests with unverified claims are amplified, it puts the audience's trust at risk.\n\n4. A Message to Aspiring Traders\nTo every young person getting into Forex, Crypto, or Stocks: Don't fall for the hype. The rented jets and luxury cars are marketing, not mastery. I've been in this market for a while and never purchased a single course because nearly everything is available for free online if you're willing to put in the work.\n\nWhat do you think: is this 'flex culture' helping or hurting young entrepreneurs and traders in India?",
